ControlAnimation for WinForms
==============================================

###Based on the work of Steffen Mangold of balticSD
* Migrated to VS 2013 and slightly modified by me to match resharper coding standards (yes, there is more work that can be done here)


###Usage

## It's likely that you only need the dll that is created by the ControlAnimation class library project
* Just build the solution and reference the dll or the solution itself
* Check the test application for examples on how to use the control itself
